have a saying: “It's the first step that counts.” Beginners always have the mentality of choosing the right course by considering the number of people registering for this course and whether it is offered by a reputable University or not. **Therefore, prestigious schools have more students enrolling in their courses, don't they?**\n","- **_Answering this question will help_** beginners have a basis to believe whether their course selection criteria are appropriate, from which they can adjust their course selection criteria accordingly.\n","- **_How we answer this question:_** We will
